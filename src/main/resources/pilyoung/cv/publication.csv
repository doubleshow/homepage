E., Kim, P*, & Ho, S*.",Journal Paper,Journal of Neuroendocrinology,2011,,,"This overview attempts to synthesize current understandings of the neuroendocrine basis of parenting. The parent-infant bond is central to the human condition, contributes to risks for mood and anxiety disorders, and provides the potential for resiliency and protection against the development of psychopathology. Animal models of parenting provide compelling evidence that biological mechanisms may be studied in humans. This has led to brain imaging and endocrine system studies of human parents using baby stimuli and concerted psychological and behavioral measures. Certain brain circuits and related hormonal systems, including subcortical regions for motivation (striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus and hippocampus) and cortical regions for social cognition (anterior cingulate, insula, medial frontal and orbitofrontal cortices) appear to be involved. These brain circuits work with a range of endocrine systems to manage stress, motivate appropriate parental caring behavior with flexibility appropriate to the environment. Work in this field promises to link evolving models of parental brain performance with resilience, risk and treatment toward mother-infant mental health.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/218486462011c,Neural Recruitment during Failed Motor Inhibition Differentiates Youths with Bipolar Disorder and Severe Mood Dysregulation,"Deveney, C.

W.",Book Chapter,Biosocial Research Contributions to Understanding Family Processes and Problems,2011,,,"We review the effects of genes and family resources on families and children. Poverty increases children's exposures to environmental risk factors such as child abuse, poor quality parenting, and suboptimal physical environment. These environmental risk factors interact with various genes to predict more behavioral problems in childhood. Relations between genes and environments are likely more complex than simple individual gene x environment interactions. In some cases, genetic or environmental factors may have different impacts in low- vs. high-SES groups. Finally, we speculate about biological mechanisms that may account for gene by environment interactions. Poverty and related environmental factors may interact with genes, which may lead to abnormal brain development as well as _dysregulation in both neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine stress regulatory systems.",http://www.springerlink.com/content/xrn3k4118w757831/2010a,The Plasticity of Human Maternal Brain: Longitudinal Changes in Brain Anatomy during the Early Postpartum Period,"Kim, P., Leckman, J. F., Mayes, L. C., Feldman, R, Wang, X., & Swain, J. E.",Journal Paper,Behaviorial Neuroscience,2010,,,"Animal studies suggest that structural changes occur in the maternal brain during the early postpartum period in regions such as the hypothalamus, amygdala, parietal lobe, and prefrontal cortex and such changes are related to the expression of maternal behaviors. In an attempt to explore this in humans, we conducted a prospective longitudinal study to examine gray matter changes using voxel-based morphometry on high resolution magnetic resonance images of mothers' brains at two time points: 2-4 weeks postpartum and 3-4 months postpartum. Comparing gray matter volumes across these two time points, we found increases in gray matter volume of the prefrontal cortex, parietal lobes, and midbrain areas. Increased gray matter volume in the midbrain including the hypothalamus, substantia nigra, and amygdala was associated with maternal positive perception of her baby. These results suggest that the first months of motherhood in humans are accompanied by structural changes in brain regions implicated in maternal motivation and behaviors.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/209396692010b,Perceived Quality of Maternal Care in Childhood and Structure and Function of Mothers' Brain in the Postpartum,"Kim, P., Leckman, J. F., Mayes, L. C., Newman, M., Feldman, R. & Swain, J. E.",,Developmental Science,2010,,,"Animal studies indicate that early maternal care has long-term effects on brain areas related to social attachment and parenting, whereas neglectful mothering is linked with heightened stress reactivity in the hippocampus across the lifespan. The present study explores the possibility, using magnetic resonance imaging, that perceived quality of maternal care in childhood is associated with brain structure and functional responses to salient infant stimuli among human mothers in the first postpartum month. Mothers who reported higher maternal care in childhood showed larger grey matter volumes in the superior and middle frontal gyri, orbital gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus. In response to infant cries, these mothers exhibited higher activations in the middle frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus, whereas mothers reporting lower maternal care showed increased hippocampal activations. These findings suggest that maternal care in childhood may be associated with anatomy and functions in brain regions implicated in appropriate responsivity to infant stimuli in human mothers.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/205907292010c,Multiple Risk as a Potential Explanatory Mechanism for the SES-health Gradient,"Evans, G. W. & Kim, P.",,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2010,,,"The social patterning of disease and mortality provokes a search for explanation. One potential underlying explanation for socioeconomic status (SES) gradients in health is exposure to multiple risk factors. Income and class tend to sort individuals into different settings that are often accompanied by systematic differences in environmental quality. Housing and neighborhood quality, pollutants and toxins, crowding and congestion, and noise exposure all vary with SES. Persons lower in SES also experience more adverse interpersonal relationships with family members, friends, supervisors, and community members. Furthermore, exposure to these multiple risk factors is associated with worse health outcomes. Thus, the convergence of exposure to multiple physical and psychosocial risk factors accompanying disadvantage may account for a portion of SES gradients in health in both childhood and adulthood.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/202018732009a,The Built Environment and Children,"Evans, G.

Here, we used multimodal neuroimaging in healthy adults who were at different distances from the World Trade Center on 9/11/01 to examine the neural mechanisms that may underlie this association. More than 3 years after 9/11/01, adults with closer proximity to the disaster had lower gray matter volume in amygdala, hippocampus, insula, anterior cingulate, and medial prefrontal cortex, with control for age, gender, and total gray matter volume. Further analysis showed a nonlinear (first-order quadratic) association between total number of traumas in lifetime and amygdala gray matter volume and function in the whole group. Post hoc analysis of subgroups with higher versus lower levels of lifetime trauma exposure revealed systematic associations between amygdala gray matter volume, amygdala functional reactivity, and anxiety that suggest a nonlinear trajectory in the neural response to accumulated trauma in healthy adults.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/182345242007a,Sad Dads: Paternal Postpartum Depression,"Kim, P. & Swain, J. E.",,Psychiatry,2007,,,"The postpartum period is associated with many adjustments to fathers that pose risks for depression. Estimates of the prevalence of paternal postpartum depression (PPD) in the first two months postpartum vary in the postpartum period from 4 to 25 percent. Paternal PPD has high comorbidity with maternal PPD and might also be associated with other postpartum psychiatric disorders. Studies so far have only used diagnostic criteria for maternal PPD to investigate paternal PPD, so there is an urgent need to study the validity of these scales for men and develop accurate diagnostic tools for paternal PPD. Paternal PPD has negative impacts on family, including increasing emotional and behavioral problems among their children (either directly or through the mother) and increasing conflicts in the marital relationship. Changes in hormones, including testosterone, estrogen, cortisol, vasopressin, and prolactin, during the postpartum period in fathers may be biological risk factors in paternal PPD. Fathers who have ecological risk factors, such as excessive stress from becoming a parent, lack of social supports for parenting, and feeling excluded from mother-infant bonding, may be more likely to develop paternal PPD. Support from their partner, educational programs, policy for paid paternal leave, as well as consideration of psychiatric care may help fathers cope with stressful experiences during the postpartum period.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922346/2007b,Cumulative Risk Exposure and HPA and SAM Dysregulation among Young Adolescents: The Moderating Role of Maternal Responsiveness,"Evans, G.
