=== DO YOU FEEL THAT PEOPLE IN HCI KNOW YOU?
not enough
== What is your plan for getting to the point where people know you?          
Quite some people now know about my project on 3D-printed tactile pictures.
But not enough. I plan to attend more conferences, share our software, and visit places to give talks. 
In particular, my group is planning to submit a few papers to ASSETS, a venue new to us but is very keen on 
learning about our work.
== Do enough of the right people know you for writing letters? You need a big net
