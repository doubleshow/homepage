  "note": "The New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) track is meant (1) to provide researchers with a forum for presenting and getting early feedback on novel research ideas and promising work that has not yet been fully evaluated; and (2) to accelerate the exposure of the community to early yet promising and potentially\r\ninspiring research efforts. The track received 162 submissions, from which 147 fit the call for papers. The paper selection process consisted of two phases. In the first phase, all conforming submissions were reviewed by three PC members. In the second phase, online discussions were used to finalize the paper selection. In the end, 31 papers (22 %) were selected as part of the program. They cover new perspectives on such topics as dependability, collaboration, modeling, and support for tomorrowâ€™s developer. All accepted papers will be presented at a poster session at the conference. Among the accepted papers, the 20 deemed most likely to yield engaging discussions will be presented in one of the four NIER sessions"
