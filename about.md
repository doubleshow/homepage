## About Me

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I lead the [Sikuli Lab](http://lab.sikuli.org) where I educate a team of talented students to conduct cutting-edge research to make computers see better and interact with humans more naturally. One example is Sikuli Script, a GUI automation tool based on screenshots. Since its release as open-source software in 2010, it has been downloaded more than 200,000 times and used by a large community of users for a variety of purposes such as testing, IT automation, scraping, data transfer, and gaming.

Education: I received my PhD from MIT where I did research on interactive computer vision algorithms that enable the creation of several novel search and automation applications. I spent three years at the University of Maryland College Park to receive postdoctoral training in interdisciplinary research involving human-centered computing, computer vision, and software engineering.
